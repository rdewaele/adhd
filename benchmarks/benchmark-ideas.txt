First test per-core properties, then test thread/process scaling.

- bandwidth
	- reduction -> global mem
	- cache bandbr
- latency (arraywalk)
	- cost of overcommit
		- shared/unshared
	- strides > L1 to force only L2 hits
	- vectorized version of arraywalk
- flops double/single
- inter process communication for processes doing pipelined parallelism
- core pipeline
	- single/dual/triple/quad thread CPI
	- dependent/independent 1 thread, 2 thread
	- scalar/float pipeline utilisation

- outstanding cache requests
	- latency hiding: test L2 duty cycle with two or more threads constantly
	  reading from L2 by comparing to a one-thread L2 baseline test
